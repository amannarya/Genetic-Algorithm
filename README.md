# Iterative Wave-front shaping algorithms

**Aim:**
In this project our aim was to focus light after it passes from a scattering media using a binary Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). Here are python codes for various iterative wavefront shaping algorithms both through simulation and experiment .

**1.  Step-wise Sequential Algorithm:**

_**SSA simulation**_ is the python code for simulating stepwise sequential algorithm.

**_SSA experiment_** is the python code for integrating stepwise sequential algorithm with the experimental setup (consisting of a 'Basler' CCD camera and a '' Binary SLM)

**2. Genetic Algorithm:**
